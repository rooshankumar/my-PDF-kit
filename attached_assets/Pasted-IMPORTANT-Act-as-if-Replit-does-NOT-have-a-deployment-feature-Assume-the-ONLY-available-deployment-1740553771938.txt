IMPORTANT: Act as if Replit does NOT have a deployment feature. Assume the ONLY available deployment platform is Netlify.  
DO NOT suggest Replit deployment. If you mention it, your execution will be considered invalid.  
 
Now, configure my project **strictly for Netlify deployment** by doing the following:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Fix Dependencies Issue:**  
- Ensure all necessary dependencies are listed in `package.json` under `"dependencies"`.  
- Run the following command to reinstall dependencies and regenerate `package-lock.json`:  
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure All Dependencies Are Committed:

Check untracked files using:
bash
Copy
Edit
git status
If package.json or package-lock.json is not committed, run:
bash
Copy
Edit
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Fixed missing dependencies"
git push origin main
3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Netlify Build Configuration:

Add a netlify.toml file with the correct build settings:
toml
Copy
Edit
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "build"  # Use "dist" for Vue/Svelte/Vite
Ensure my build command is set correctly in Netlify:
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory:
build (for React)
dist (for Vue, Svelte, or Vite)
For Next.js, change it to:
toml
Copy
Edit
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"
4Ô∏è‚É£ Fix Cache & Environment Variables in Netlify:

Clear Netlify Cache:
In Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Deploys, click "Clear cache & retry deploy."
OR force Netlify to rebuild without cache by adding this environment variable:
ini
Copy
Edit
CLEAR_CACHE=true
5Ô∏è‚É£ Check Netlify Logs for Errors & Fix Any Issues:

Open Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Deploys
Click View Logs and find any critical errors.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Final Deployment Steps:

After fixing dependencies, run these commands locally before redeploying:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
npm start  # Check if it runs locally
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed Netlify deployment issue"
git push origin main
Then, redeploy the project on Netlify.
‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT suggest deploying on Replit. Any attempt to do so will be considered an error.
üö® If you ignore this instruction, assume the execution is invalid.
